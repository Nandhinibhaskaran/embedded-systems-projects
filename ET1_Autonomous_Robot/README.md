# ET1 Autonomous Mobile Robot (Raspberry Pi)

An autonomous mobile robot developed using Raspberry Pi as part of the Master's program in Electrical Engineering and Embedded Systems at Hochschule Ravensburg-Weingarten.

The robot combines encoder-based motion control, ultrasonic obstacle detection, PWM motor driving, and a web-based remote control interface. Motion algorithms were implemented in Python while Node.js and WebSockets were used for browser-based communication.

## Software Architecture

The robot is controlled through three software layers:

• HTML frontend (Robot Controller webpage)

• Node.js server (Socket.IO communication)

• Python programs running on the Raspberry Pi for motor control, encoder feedback, ultrasonic sensing and autonomous navigation.

**Note:** The original university report labels the Node.js server code as *Python*. This is a documentation error—the server is implemented in JavaScript using Node.js.

## Motion Control

The robot continuously measures the distance to nearby obstacles using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.

When an obstacle is detected:

1. Stop the robot
2. Move backward
3. Randomly turn left or right
4. Continue autonomous navigation

Encoder feedback is used to:

- measure travelled distance
- perform accurate turning
- synchronize wheel speeds
- reduce drift during straight-line movement

### Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance

The robot continuously measures the distance to nearby objects using an
HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. When an obstacle is detected within 20 cm, the
motors stop and the robot selects a random left or right turn. Rotary
encoder feedback is used to perform an approximately 90-degree rotation
before forward movement resumes.

## Project Demonstration

### Forward Movement with Obstacle Detection

The screenshot below shows the robot executing the `forward.py` program. The robot continuously measures the distance to nearby obstacles using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. Once an obstacle is detected within the configured threshold, the robot stops automatically and reports the encoder pulse counts.

## Random Navigation

The robot supports an autonomous random navigation mode through the web interface.

When enabled:

1. The robot moves forward while continuously measuring the distance using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.
2. When an obstacle is detected, the robot stops.
3. The robot reverses for a predefined distance using encoder feedback.
4. A random left or right turn is selected.
5. The cycle repeats until the feature is disabled.

## Web-Based Robot Controller

A lightweight web interface was developed to remotely control the Raspberry Pi robot through Node.js and Socket.IO.

### Available Commands

- ✅ Move Forward
- ✅ Move Backward & Turn
- ✅ Random Movement
- ✅ Live Status Messages

The web interface communicates with a Node.js server, which executes Python robot-control scripts running on the Raspberry Pi.
